Using expert knowledge to estimate ecological and socio-economic impacts of invasive species. 

Assessing the ecological and socio-economic impacts of an organisms is one of the key steps for estimating the risk of future incursions and prioritizing resources across the biosecrity system.

Oftentimes these questions are extremely difficult to address, due to limitations and inconsistencies in the scientific knowledgebase. In such cases, society often calls on experts for advice that requires judgments that go beyond well-established knowledge. 

In this project, we explore the use of structured approach for consulting judgments from experts about uncertain quantity or process in their domain of expertise.
